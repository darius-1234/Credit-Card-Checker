# Credit-Card-Checker

This is a basic credit card verifier, implemented using the Luhn algorithm. There is a GUI version, whereby a ktinter GUI pops up and the user can try to verify a credit card number, each time being met with the appropriate response. There is also a web version, where the user can enter the number into the searchbar (as if searching the number), and the user is then met with a page containing the result.
